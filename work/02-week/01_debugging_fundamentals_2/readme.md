# Debugging Fundamentals 2

### Objectives
*After this lesson, students will be able to:*

* Given sample code, set a breakpoint and look at the current state
* Run app in degub mode and analyse it on a line by line bases at runtime
* Debug a simple app

### Preparation
*Before this lesson, students should read over the following lessons:*

- [Debugging Fundamentals 1](../04-uworkflow-and-dev-tools/debugging-fundamentals-1-lesson)


## Breakpoints

A breakpoint is a marker that you can set to specify where execution should pause when you are running your application in the IDE's debugger. Breakpoints are stored in the IDE (not in your application's code) and persist between debugging sessions and IDE sessions.

## Bug Fixing

You have been provided [a simple calculator](starter-code). Given that the user enters two numbers, a result is shown when the user pressed one of the operation buttons.

However, it is broken. Sometimes, it crashes and some of the buttons behave unexpectedly.

Clone the [provided sample code](starter-code), import the project into Android Studio, and fix as many bugs as possible using the help of breakpoints and the stack traces.

If you do not understand what a stack trace's message is telling you, try googling it to see if someone else has encountered a similar issue.
