## Introduction

It's almost time for the Super Bowl! Now that we've learned about ArrayLists and ListViews, you're going to build your own fantasy football roster. You will be able to type in your player names, click an add button, and have the players appear on your list. You'll also have the ability to drop players from your list. (No knowledge of football is actually required to complete this lab.)

This lab will help you to practice creating and manipulating Java collections as well as creating and using ListViews/Adapters.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- EditText that allows the user to type in a player's name
- Button that will add the name currently entered in the EditText
- Button that will remove the most recent player added to your roster
- A ListView to display all players on your roster
- An Adapter to tie together your ListView and data

**Bonus:**

- Add image or logo next to the player names
- Add player positions with the players
- Don't allow duplicate players on the roster (combination of name and position)

#### Starter code

There is no starter code for this lab.

#### Deliverable

An Android app that follows the requirements above. There are no design requirements aside from having the EditText, ListView, and 2 Buttons; feel free to play around with color, font, backgrounds, etc.

Post the project on GitHub. Ensure that the project builds and runs successfully and that the tests are passing. Please refer to the Testing Quick Guide for info on how to run a test in Android Studio.
